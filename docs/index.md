# Pizzaiolo companion

## Goal / Purpose

The goal of this app is to provide a tool for pizzaiolos (pizza makers) to record their pizza journeys.  
That means it should:
- Save pizza recipes
- Help creating a journal on past pizza experiences
- Rate past experiences to identify what works best

## Architecture

The architecture is kept pretty simple. We got three main entities:

- Recipe: The pizza recipe
- Journal: A journal to store/log past pizza experiences
- Gallery: A place to store images of past pizza experiences, linked to journal entries
